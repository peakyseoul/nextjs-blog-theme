# HTML Basics

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Langauge. 
Hypertext - text displayed on a computer that has links to other hypertext documents.
Markup Language - let's you annotate text to define how it should be displayed. 

## HTML Tags

HTML is made up of tags markup the text of a document in order to tell the browser how it should be displayed.

* Enclosed in angle brackets: `<h1>`
* Not displayed on the resulting web page
* Inform the browser about how certain elements should be displayed.

## HTML Structure

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Your Page Title</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <!--This is where you will be writing your sigma code-->
    </body>
</html>

```

The `<head>` tag contains information about your website or *metadata*. This where title, language or time-zone is indicated.
The `<body>` tag contains everthing that will be displayed to the user.

* Tags can go inside other tags
* We use indenting to show the structure of the tags
* The structure of an html document is a tree
* Typically, tags come in pairs - openning and closing tags.

***

## Basic Tags:

`<h1>` - Heading one tag. typically used to indicate headings in the page. \

# h1 Heading

## h2 Heading

### h3 Heading

#### h4 Heading

##### h5 Heading

###### h6 Heading


`<p>`  - Paragraph tag. These used to include a paragraph of a text. Note that there is an automatic line break (new line) after these tags. \
`<i>`  - Italized text. These make the text *cursive*. \
`<b>`  - These help to make the text **bold**. \
`<hr>` - Horizontal Rule. No closing tag. Creates a horizontal line on the screen. 

***

`<br>` - Line Break. Creates a new line. 

## Horizontal Rules
***

`<s>` - Strinkethrough tag. ~~This is what it looks like~~

## Some other examples of tags

```
<p>
    This is text that is <strong>important</strong>.
    <br>
    This is text that needs <em>emphasized</em>.
    <br>
    This is text that needs <mark>highlighted</mark>.
</p>

```

## Lists ordered vs unordered.

Lists can be done in ordered and unordered fashion. Following are the examples:

Ordered:

1.  Item 1
2.  Consectetur adipiscing elit
3.  Integer molestie lorem at massa

```
<ol>
<li>Item 1</li>
<li>Item 2</li>
<li>Item 3</li>
</ol>

```

Unordered:

*   Item 1
*   Item 2
*   Item 3

```
<ul>
<li>Item 1</li>
<li>Item 2</li>
<li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

```

## Links

Linke can be done using `<a>` tag. 
The following is an example of a link to google site.

```
<a href="google.com">
  Click here to go to Google
</a>
```

*   [Click here to go to Google](https://google.com)

## HTML attributes

```
<tag attribute="value">Tag content here</tag>
```


Some of the tags will include html attributes. In the example above, "href" is the name of the attribute and "google.com" is the value of that attribute. \

## images

Image tag in HTML is `<img>` and it doesn't have a closing tag. 
Image tag helps us insert images into our pages through "src" attribute.

```
<img src="/images/random-image.jpeg" alt="Image not found" width="50px" height="50px">
  
```

![Image alt text](/images/random-image.jpeg "Image Title")

## Navigation Bar

Having easy to use navigation bar is important for every website. 
The following is an example of a navigation bar:

```
<nav>
  <li><a href="home.html">Home</a></li>
  <li><a href="news.html">News</a></li>
  <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
  <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
</nav>

```

# CSS basics

## Adding External CSS
Rather than putting all of our CSS rules in a style tag, it's also possible to add CSS code that's written in a separate file. The file should be a .css file, such as my_style.css \
Example: \
my_page.html 

```
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Your Page Title</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>CodeHS</h1>
    </body>
</html>

```
style.css
```
/* 
* General format 
*/

selector {
    property: value;
    property: value;
}

h1 {
    font-size: 30px;
    color: red;
}

```

## CSS selector by tags.
Styling HTML can be by tags. The following code selects all h1 tags and styles the font-size to be at 30px and color at red.

```
h1 {
    font-size: 30px;
    color: red;
}
```

## CSS selector by class.

Class is an attribute that we can add to html tags to style a group of elements. If we use a class as a selector, it selects all the elements that share that class. \
The class style overrides tag style in case of a conflict. In other words, if a select-by-tag rule says that the element should be red, and a select-by-class rule says the same element should be green, the class rule takes precedence and the element will be green. \
You can add a class to a tag like this:

```
<tag class="class-name"></tag>
```

You can add multiple classes to a tag by separating class names with spaces:

```
<tag class="class1 class2 class3"></tag>
```

Class names:
* Cannot start with a number
* Should be all lowercase
* Should use dashes (-) between words i.e. "class-name"
* Should be descriptive

```
/*
* This rule will apply to only <h1> elements
* with the class "alert"
*/

h1.alert {
font-size: 20px;
}
```

## CSS selector by class.

id is an attribute that we can add to an HTML tag to style that specific element. \
An element can only have one id and the id of an element should be unique. \
There should be only one tag with a given id on any web page. \
Using the ID as a selector will select the one element that has that ID. \

```
<tag id="id-name"></tag>
```

css:

```
#logo {
    font-size: 20px;
    color: red;
}
```

## Divs

Divs are used to group together several different HTML elements into one block. \
A div creates a new block of elements, a block always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available in its container. \
Grouping elements together in a div allows us to style that block as one unit. \
HTML:
```
<div id="block-one">
    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p>Welcome to my web page.</p>
</div>
<div id="block-two">
    <ul>
        <li>Home</li>
        <li>About</li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

CSS:

```
#block-one {
    color: 
red;
}

#block-two {
    color: 
blue;
}
```

## Spans

Spans are used to group together smaller chunks of HTML code in-line. \
Spans do not create a new block, they are usually used to add style to a small chunk of HTML inside of a line (such as a line in a paragraph). \
Example HTML:

HTML:

```
<p>This is a <span class="big">paragraph</span> of <span class="small">text</span></p>
```

CSS:

```
.big {
    font-size: 20px;
}

.small {
    font-size: 8px;
}
```

# What is an HTML?

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Langauge. 
Hypertext - text displayed on a computer that has links to other hypertext documents.
Markup Language - let's you annotate text to define how it should be displayed. 

## HTML Tags

HTML is made up of tags markup the text of a document in order to tell the browser how it should be displayed.

* Enclosed in angle brackets: `<h1>`
* Not displayed on the resulting web page
* Inform the browser about how certain elements should be displayed.

## HTML Structure

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Your Page Title</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <!--This is where you will be writing your sigma code-->
    </body>
</html>

```

The `<head>` tag contains information about your website or *metadata*. This where title, language or time-zone is indicated.
The `<body>` tag contains everthing that will be displayed to the user.

### Tags can go inside other tags
### We use indenting to show the structure of the tags
### The structure of an html document is a tree
### Typically, tags come in pairs - openning and closing tags.
